# Why QUIC

QUIC is a name, not an acronym. It is pronounced exactly like the English work
"quick".

QUIC is in many ways what could be seen as "HTTP/3", the logical next step in
the web transport evolution, but it isn't just limited to transporting
HTTP. The desire to make the web and data in general delivered faster to end
users is probably the largest reason and push that initially triggered the
creation of this protocol.

So why create a new transport protocol and why do it on top of UDP?
