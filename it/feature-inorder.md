## â€ŽIn order delivery

QUIC guarantees in-order delivery of streams, but not between-streams. This
means that each stream will send data and maintain data order, but each stream
may reach the destination in a different order than what the application sent
them at the sending side!

For example: stream A and B are transferred from a server to a client. Stream
A is started first and then stream B. In QUIC, a lost packet would only affect
the stream(s) to which the lost packet belongs. If stream A gets a packet
lost, and stream B does not, stream B may continue its transfers and complete
while stream A is getting its lost packet re-transmitted. This was not possible
with HTTP/2.
