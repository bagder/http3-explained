# HTTP/3

As mentioned previously, the first and primary protocol to transport over QUIC
is HTTP.

Much like HTTP/2 was once introduced to transport HTTP over the wire in a
completely new way, HTTP/3 is yet again introducing a new way to send HTTP over
the network.

HTTP still maintains the same paradigms and concepts like before. There are
headers and a body, there is a request and a response. There are verbs,
cookies and caching. What primarily changes with HTTP/3 is how the bits get
sent over to the other side of the communication.

In order to do HTTP over QUIC, changes were required and the results of this
is what we now call HTTP/3. These changes were required because of the
different nature that QUIC provides as opposed to TCP. These changes include:

 - In QUIC the streams are provided by the transport itself, while in HTTP/2
   the streams were done within the HTTP layer.

 - Due to the streams being independent of each other, the header compression
   protocol used for HTTP/2 could not be used without it causing a head of block
   situation.

 - QUIC streams are slightly different than HTTP/2 streams. The HTTP/3 section
   will detail this somewhat.
