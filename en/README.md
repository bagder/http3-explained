# HTTP/3 explained

This book effort was started in March 2018. The plan is to document HTTP/3 and
its underlying protocol: QUIC. Why, how they work, protocol details, the
implementations and more.

The book is entirely free and is meant to be a collaborative effort
involving anyone and everyone who wants to help out.

## Prerequisites

A reader of this book is presumed to have a basic understanding of TCP/IP
networking, the fundamentals of HTTP and the web. For further insights and
specifics about HTTP/2 we recommend first reading up the details in [http2
explained](https://daniel.haxx.se/http2/).

## Author

This book is created and the work is started by [Daniel
Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se/). Daniel is the founder and lead developer
of [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), the world's most widely used HTTP client
software. Daniel has worked with and on HTTP and internet protocols for over
two decades and is the author of [http2
