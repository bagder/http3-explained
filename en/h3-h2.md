# HTTP/3 compared to HTTP/2

HTTP/3 is designed for QUIC, which is a transport protocol that handles
streams by itself.

HTTP/2 is designed for TCP, and therefore handles streams in the HTTP layer.

## Similarities

The two protocols offer clients virtually identical feature sets.

- Both protocols offer server push support

- Both protocols have header compression, and QPACK and HPACK are similar in
  design.

- Both protocols offer multiplexing over a single connection using streams

## Differences

The differences are in the details and primarily there thanks to HTTP/3's use
of QUIC:

- HTTP/3 has better and more likely to work early data support thanks to
  QUIC's 0-RTT handshakes, while TCP Fast Open and TLS usually sends less data
  and often faces problems.

- HTTP/3 has much faster handshakes thanks to QUIC vs TCP + TLS.

- HTTP/3 does not exist in an insecure or unencrypted version. HTTP/2 can be
  implemented and used without HTTPS - even if this is rare on the Internet.

- HTTP/2 can be negotiated directly in a TLS handshake with the ALPN
  extension, while HTTP/3 is over QUIC so it needs an `Alt-Svc:` header
  response first to inform the client about this fact.

- HTTP/3 has no prioritization. The HTTP/2 approach to prioritization has been
  deemed too complicated, or even a downright failure, and there's work on
  creating a simpler take. This planned simpler scheme is also planned to be
  able so backport to run over HTTP/2 using HTTP/2's extension mechanism.
