The initial QUIC protocol was designed by Jim Roskind at Google and was
initially implemented in 2012, announced publicly to the world in 2013 when
Google's experimentation broadened.

Back then, QUIC was still claimed to be an acronym for "Quick UDP Internet
Connections", but that has been dropped since then.

Google implemented the protocol and subsequently deployed it both in their
widely used browser (Chrome) and in their widely used server-side services
(Google search, gmail, youtube and more). They iterated protocol versions
fairly quickly and over time they proved the concept to work reliably for a
vast portion of users.

In June 2015, the first internet draft for QUIC was sent to the IETF for
standardization, but it took until late 2016 for a QUIC working group to
get approved and started. But then it took off immediately with a high degree
of interest from many parties.

In 2017, numbers quoted by QUIC engineers at Google mentioned that around 7%
of *all* Internet traffic were already using this protocol. The Google version
of the protocol that is.
